startupindex
============

StartupIndex is a simple php project i started awhile back, its running on LAMP php plus mysql with symfony framework version 1.2, it lets you index startup companies and build an index much like crunchbase with a simple to use interface.

* Add Companies
* Add People and relation to companies (founders etc)
* Tag companies
* Related companies
* Rss aggregation for blog posts
* Some level of editorial, Admin versus reader, reader can add companies for approval, admin approves. can change users to admin also.
* Shadow versions for any company, currently saves versions, no ability to go back a version but everything is cached and saved as versions for each change.
* Commenting on companies.
* Embeddable Javascript widget for blogs (wordpress like) to show Company details from the index outside.
* Simple Layout, css YUI driven.

The code FAR from being perfect but its a good start and there is alot of house cleaning needs to be done to optimize it and clean unused code. if anyone want to contribute to it let me know alon.carmel at gmail.com for details.

Currently the layout is in HEBREW but im working on a translation, feel free to contact me if you want help
